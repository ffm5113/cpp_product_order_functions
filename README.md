# cpp_product_order_functions
The Product Order Functions Program (C++) asks the user to enter the type, quantity, thickness, width, and length of a lumber product. 

Then the program calculates the cost of the transaction using the price per board foot (1 in * 1 ft^2). 

Finally, the program displays the order total and asks the user if they would like to create another order.
